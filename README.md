# Genetic Algorithm

In Genetic Algorithm, the evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and happens in generations. 
In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated, multiple individuals are selected from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified to form a new population.
The new population is used in the next iteration of the algorithm.
The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.
